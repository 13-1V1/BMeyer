        <h2>MFGT‑100 Industrial Safety</h2>
        <p>
          Safety is paramount in any shop or lab environment.  This class used
          interactive <strong>Amatrol eLearning</strong> modules to teach the basic principles for keeping
          workplaces accident‑free.  The training covered common causes of
          accidents, the role of OSHA, and personal safety actions such as
          properly selecting and using personal protective equipment (PPE),
          communicating hazards, and locking out equipment during maintenance【237728176636443†L61-L66】.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Developed an understanding of safety policies, the consequences
            of unsafe behaviour, and how to build a strong safety culture.  We
            learned how OSHA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
            set standards for general workplace safety, material handling,
            tools, and machinery【237728176636443†L98-L105】.
          </li>
          <li>
            Completed modules on <em>Personal Protective Equipment</em> that taught how
            to identify hazards and choose appropriate protective gear for
            the head, eyes, ears, hands and body, and how to use PPE correctly【237728176636443†L113-L117】.
          </li>
          <li>
            Studied <em>Hazard Communication</em>, learning about chemical and
            biological hazards, how to read safety data sheets, and the
            importance of properly labeling containers and communicating
            risks to others【237728176636443†L125-L131】.
          </li>
          <li>
            Practiced <em>Lockout/Tagout</em> procedures, including the identification
            of hazardous energy sources, applying LOTO devices and tags, and
            understanding the energy‑control programs needed before
            servicing equipment【237728176636443†L139-L143】.
          </li>
          <li>
            Discussed ergonomics and workplace design to reduce fatigue and
            injury, as well as emergency response planning.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>MFGT‑113 Machining Fundamentals</h2>
        <p>
          This course introduced the fundamentals of machining and metal
          fabrication.  We learned to interpret engineering drawings and
          perform machine shop math, then applied that knowledge on the
          shop floor to cut and shape parts.  The program also included
          <strong>OSHA‑10</strong> certification and hands‑on experience with a range of
          machine tools【569410679499134†L117-L123】.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Gained proficiency using lathes, milling machines and drill
            presses to drill, tap and ream holes and to turn and mill
            cylindrical and flat parts to specification【569410679499134†L117-L123】.
          </li>
          <li>
            Learned to read and interpret blueprints and develop machine
            shop math skills for calculating feeds, speeds and tolerances.
            We measured parts using micrometers, calipers and other
            precision instruments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Practiced selecting appropriate tooling and cutting parameters
            for different materials and gained exposure to the basics of
            computer numerical control (CNC) machining【569410679499134†L117-L123】.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Integration with Other Disciplines</h2>
        <p>
          The skills gained in manufacturing technology complement my work in
          welding and software. Understanding how parts are machined helps
          me design better assemblies and appreciate the constraints of
          physical manufacturing when writing control software for robots and
          CNC machines.
