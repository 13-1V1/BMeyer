        <h2>Electronics &amp; Control</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding how hardware works at the component level is
          essential for building reliable systems. These courses provided a
          foundation in circuit theory, sensors and control systems.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>ESYST‑101&nbsp;Basic Electronics:</strong> Covered
            resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors and integrated
            circuits. Labs included building simple analog circuits and
            practicing soldering techniques.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ESYST‑112&nbsp;Industrial Robotics:</strong> Explored
            the fundamentals of robot kinematics, sensors, end effectors and
            programming. Built and tested small robotic arm exercises using
            sensor feedback and motion control.

        <h2>Python Programming</h2>
        <p>
          Although this course was labelled as an IoT class, it functioned
          primarily as an introduction to programming in Python. We started
          with variables, data types and arithmetic and then progressed to
          control flow — writing user‑defined functions and using loops and
          conditional logic to make programs smarter【910660651612946†L154-L159】.
          Toward the end of the semester we stepped into object‑oriented
          programming, learning how to create classes and instantiate
          objects【910660651612946†L323-L340】. Coming from a C and Java
          background, this course helped me learn Python’s syntax and idioms
          while applying familiar programming concepts.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>ESYST‑131&nbsp;Intro to Python Programming:</strong> Learned
            fundamentals such as variables, loops, functions and
            object‑oriented programming. Coming from C and Java, this course
            was an opportunity to adopt Python’s indentation‑based syntax while
            applying familiar ideas.

        <h2>Projects &amp; Experiments</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Designed and built a blinking LED circuit with a 555&nbsp;timer
            integrated circuit and learned to calculate resistor values using
            Ohm’s law from Basic&nbsp;Electronics.
          </li>
          <li>
            Built a block classification and LED feedback system for the
            Industrial&nbsp;Robotics final project. A webcam and a
            Teachable&nbsp;Machine model identified green and blue blocks
            in real time. Classification results were sent via Web&nbsp;Serial
            commands to an Arduino, which lit green, blue or white
            LEDs to demonstrate a simple
            <em>vision→decision→action</em> pipeline used in industrial
            automation【980557200099760†L10-L17】【980557200099760†L50-L114】【980557200099760†L77-L93】.
          </li>
          <li>
            Practiced writing console‑based Python programs to solidify
            concepts like loops, functions and classes introduced in the
            Intro to Python Programming course.
