        <h2>NETECH‑113 Data Center</h2>
        <p>
          This course provided a comprehensive overview of how modern data centers
          are designed, built and operated.  We studied the core components of a
          facility – servers, storage arrays, and network equipment – along with
          the infrastructure that supports them: power distribution units (PDUs),
          uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs), generators, cooling systems and
          physical security.  Understanding how these pieces fit together
          revealed the complexity behind the “cloud.”【979030371715635†L516-L547】
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Examined the key elements of a data center: compute resources,
            storage devices, networking hardware, power distribution and
            cooling systems, as well as environmental monitoring and physical
            security【979030371715635†L516-L547】.
          </li>
          <li>
            Learned about design considerations such as hot‑aisle/cold‑aisle
            layouts, airflow containment, raised floors and alternative cooling
            strategies.  We discussed metrics like power usage effectiveness
            (PUE) and the need to plan for future capacity【979030371715635†L559-L597】.
          </li>
          <li>
            Explored how effective management includes inventory control,
            environmental monitoring (temperature, humidity, power draw), and
            maintenance workflows to ensure reliable operation【979030371715635†L600-L637】.
          </li>
          <li>
            Covered redundancy and high‑availability strategies, from backup power
            systems to network failover, and considered how virtualization and
            containerization allow multiple services to run on the same physical
            hardware.

        <h2>Future Networking Goals</h2>
        <p>
          I plan to continue studying networking concepts through courses
          such as CCNA and network security. My goal is to understand how
          networks support modern applications and how to design secure,
          scalable systems.
