        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Prior to having proper instruction, I owned an FCAW machine with which
          I would create and repair small projects at home. Being self-taught at
          the time, these welds were not the prettiest—but I am proud to say
          that none of my welds from then have ever broken. I have always
          enjoyed working with my hands and welding in general, so in the Summer
          of 2025 I enrolled in an SMAW course at College of the Canyons.
        </p>

        <h2>Skills and Techniques</h2>
        <p>During my SMAW course, I gained hands-on experience with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Electrodes:</strong> Focused on 6013, 6010, and extensively
            practiced with 7018 for high-strength, low-hydrogen welds.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Beading Techniques:</strong> Mastered standard beads, whip
            and pause for penetration control, weave beads for wide coverage,
            V-beads for groove welds, and more.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Positions & Materials:</strong> Worked on projects with
            material thicknesses from 10 gauge to 3/4" steel in all welding
            positions—flat, horizontal, vertical, and overhead.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Inspection & Quality Control:</strong> Learned visual
            inspection methods and destructive testing such as bend tests to
            ensure structural integrity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> Developed the ability to diagnose
            machine issues and correct weld defects such as porosity, slag
            inclusions, and undercut.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Plans & Terminology:</strong> Knowledge of and ability to
            read WPS, Welding Symbols, and blueprints with an understanding of
            concepts and math calculations.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Equipment & Tools</h2>
        <p>
          My training has included the use of a variety of welding machines and
          tools:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lincoln Electric SMAW welders for class projects</li>
          <li>Angle grinders for material preparation and cleanup</li>
          <li>CAG-A, PAC, OFC for weld preparation</li>
          <li>Clamps, jigs, and fixtures for secure work positioning</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Safety & Best Practices</h2>
        <p>Safety is an essential part of my welding education ensuring:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Knowledge and understanding of SDS and OSHA standards</li>
          <li>
            Proper PPE usage: welding helmet, safety glasses, gloves, and
            flame-resistant clothing
          </li>
          <li>Ventilation procedures to avoid inhaling fumes</li>
          <li>Safe electrode handling and machine shut-down protocols</li>
          <li>Work area organization to prevent tripping or fire hazards</li>
        </ul>
