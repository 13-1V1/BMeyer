        <h2>Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW)</h2>
        <p>
          My SMAW coursework took me from striking my first arc through
          mastering all‑position welds.  Over three sequential classes I
          practiced flat, horizontal, vertical and overhead groove and fillet
          welds, learned to choose electrodes and settings for different
          metals, and prepared weld coupons for inspection.  This sequence
          culminated in hands‑on tests and NC3 certification.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>WELD‑101A Intro to SMAW:</strong> Covered equipment
            setup and safety, electrode types and polarity, and produced
            flat‑position stringer beads and fillet welds.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>WELD‑101B Intermediate SMAW:</strong> Built on
            fundamentals with horizontal and vertical groove welds,
            emphasising arc length, travel speed and heat control.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>WELD‑101C Advanced SMAW:</strong> Introduced overhead
            and multi‑pass welding, with a focus on identifying and
            correcting common defects.  Completed test coupons for
            certification and learned about weld codes and inspection.

        <h2>Metal Fabrication &amp; TIG Welding</h2>
        <p>
          Beyond arc welding I began exploring the broader world of metal
          fabrication and precision TIG welding.  These introductory courses
          taught me how to read blueprints, lay out materials and use shop
          tools to cut and assemble parts.  In TIG lab sessions I worked on
          controlling the torch, adding filler rod and maintaining clean,
          precise welds on mild steel and aluminium.  I plan to refine
          these skills in future semesters.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>WELD‑100A Intro to Metal Fabrication:</strong> An
            overview of fabrication tools and techniques.  Projects included
            simple fixtures and frames cut with saws and formed with grinders
            and drills.  Emphasis was on layout, measurement and safe use of
            equipment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>WELD‑112A Intro to Gas Tung Arc Welding (TIG):</strong>
            Focused on establishing a stable arc, adding filler rod and
            controlling heat input.  Practiced TIG welds on coupons to
            develop coordination and puddle control.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <!-- High‑level skills and safety habits that underpin all welding work -->
      <section>
        <h2>Skills &amp; Safety</h2>
        <p>
          Welding is as much about preparation and safety as it is about
          puddle control.  These classes instilled habits that carry over
          into every project.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Setting up welding machines correctly for different electrodes and metals.</li>
          <li>Preparing joints and fit‑up to ensure strong, consistent welds.</li>
          <li>Inspecting welds visually and destructively to identify defects and improve technique.</li>
          <li>Following shop discipline and PPE protocols to protect yourself and others.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Certifications &amp; Next Steps</h2>
        <p>
          I earned certificates at each SMAW level and am working toward
          proficiency in additional processes such as MIG and flux‑cored
          welding.  As I complete more advanced projects I’ll add photos
          and details here.
