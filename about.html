      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        I am a multi-skilled individual with a diverse background across numerous fields.
        Over the years, I have held many roles, developing a wide range of technical and creative abilities.
        My most recent professional position was as a self-employed handyman, providing a variety of repair and maintenance services.
      </p>
      <p>
        After taking time for personal growth, I chose to invest further in my future by pursuing higher education.
        In the Spring of 2025, I enrolled at College of the Canyons to expand my skills and knowledge in the trades.
        Since then, I have been a dedicated full-time student, driven by overwhelming ambition and a clear, expansive academic plan.
        My goal is to combine my hands-on experience with formal training to excel in both technical and creative endeavors.
