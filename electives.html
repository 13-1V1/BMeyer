        <h2>SPAN‑101 Elementary Spanish I</h2>
        <p>
          This introductory Spanish course laid the foundation for communicating
          in another language.  Students develop basic listening, speaking,
          reading and writing skills while gaining awareness of the cultures of
          the Spanish‑speaking world【750474617505847†L69-L75】.  As a novice
          learner, I built vocabulary and grammar fundamentals and practiced
          conversational phrases and simple compositions.
        </p>

      <!-- Electronic Music Composition -->
      <section>
        <h2>MUSIC‑142 Electronic Music Composition</h2>
        <p>
          In this creative class we used computers and music software to develop
          our own musical language.  The course presented the composition and
          production of in‑studio music in a variety of contemporary idioms using
          music technology【513889227786041†L117-L124】.  We were encouraged to
          explore new sounds, collaborate with classmates and push the
          boundaries of what music can be【513889227786041†L127-L132】.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Composed and produced original tracks using a digital audio
          workstation and software instruments.</li>
          <li>Experimented with synthesizers, sampling and effects to craft
          unique timbres.</li>
          <li>Presented works‑in‑progress and received feedback through class

      <!-- Introduction to Pro Tools -->
      <section>
        <h2>MUSIC‑193A Introduction to Pro Tools</h2>
        <p>
          This hands‑on course introduced the Avid Pro Tools digital audio
          workstation.  We learned to navigate the software, record audio
          tracks, edit using shortcuts, and mix a final project【110728348425008†L60-L80】.
          By the end of the class, I could install and configure a Pro Tools
          system, route audio through the DAW and perform basic mixing
          operations【110728348425008†L73-L80】.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Installed and configured a Pro Tools system and audio interface.</li>
          <li>Recorded and routed audio through multiple tracks within the DAW.</li>
          <li>Edited clips, applied fades and performed fundamental mix
          operations.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Fundamentals of Drawing -->
      <section>
        <h2>ART‑125A Fundamentals of Drawing</h2>
        <p>
          Drawing is fundamental to visual expression.  This elective taught
          observational drawing techniques—hand‑eye coordination, line quality and
          basic perspective.  The class emphasised that observational drawing
          underpins all representational image making and provided step‑by‑step
          exercises to build confidence【80927809454543†L188-L194】.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Practiced drawing from observation to capture proportion and form.</li>
          <li>Explored shading, texture and composition to create depth on
          paper.</li>
          <li>Developed a regular sketching habit to improve hand‑eye
          coordination.</li>
        </ul>
